# CS441-Project
CS 441 Fall 2022 Parser Project

I took a few liberties with this project including: a scanner that returns a list of
tokens instead of one token at a time, the user can input a file name, and the program
will say "yes" or "no" if the file can be parsed. 

I decided to do all the programming from scratch so the code is a bit hard to follow and 
definetly not the most efficient.
